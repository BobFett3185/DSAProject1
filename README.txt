Include a README.txt file explaining the IDE that you used. Permissible IDEs -> Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ; 
Other IDEs need permission from TA before project submission. If no IDE used and the program need to be executed on the command prompt, 
give elaborate instructions on how to run and execute your program. Your README file should also state what works and what doesn’t work 
and contain sample run of your program. 
Zip your files into one file before submitting, have the ‘readme’ file outside of zip file (elearning lets multiple files in one submission). 
Use good style and layout and comment your code well.
